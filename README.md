# CAR PARKING SPACE DETECTION USING YOLO


This project aims to develop a car parking space detection system using YOLO (You Only Look Once), a real-time object detection system. The system detects and locates vacant parking spots in a parking lot using images or video footage captured by cameras.

To run the project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the necessary dependencies by running the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
3.  Collect a dataset of images or video footage of a parking lot and label the available parking spots.
4.  Train the YOLOv3 model on the dataset using the provided scripts.
5.  Run the parking space detection system on a test video or images using the command: python parking_space_detection.py
6.  The system will display the number of available parking spots in real-time.

The project is developed using Python programming language and the YOLOv3 architecture. It can be integrated into smart parking systems to improve the parking experience for drivers.

For more information on the project and how to use it, refer to the documentation provided in the "docs" folder.
